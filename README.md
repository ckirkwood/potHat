# potHat
#### Custom Raspberry Pi HAT, using the Adafruit perma-proto HAT

Built as a solution to provide analogue inputs to the Raspberry Pi without the hassle of setting up a breadboard each time. The proto HAT breaks out the Pi's GPIO, so extra-long headers can be used to connect Pimoroni's Blinkt.

With a few spare rows on the proto HAT, I added a trio of LEDs so that I could run (and learn) simple workshop scripts like traffic lights without the setup.

A few lumps of Sugru also help to secure the HAT and the pots.
